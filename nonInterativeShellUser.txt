Problem:
System admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has installed a backup agent tool on all app servers, as per tool's requirements they need to create a user with a non-interactive shell.

So create a user named siva with a non-interactive shell in the app02 server.


Solution:
useradd siva -s /bin/false

or 

useradd siva -s /sbin/nologin
