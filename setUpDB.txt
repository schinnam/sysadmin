Problem:
We recently migrated one of our WordPress website from old server to a new infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter. We have already setup LAMP except database. We have also restored website code however we need to restore database to make it work on new infra. Please perform the below given steps on DB host:


a. Install/Configure MariaDB server.

b. Create a database with name kodekloud_db5.

c. There is a DB dump on jump_host under location /home/thor/db.sql. Restore this database in newly create database.

d. Create a user kodekloud_aim and set any password you like.

e. Grant full permissions to user kodekloud_aim on database kodekloud_db5.


f. Update database related details in /data/wp-config.php file on storage server which is our NFS server having a share /data that is mounted on each app server on location /var/www/html.
