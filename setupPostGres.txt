As per details shared by Nautilus application development team. they are planning to deploy one newly developed application on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. Application uses PostgreSQL database. 
So as a pre-requisite we need to setup PostgreSQL database server as per requirements shared below:


a. Install and configure PostgreSQL database on Nautilus database server.

b. Create a database user kodekloud_sam and set its password to BruCStnMT5.

c. Create a database kodekloud_db10 and grant full permissions to user kodekloud_sam on this database.

d. Make appropriate settings to allow all local clients (local socket connections) to connect to the kodekloud_db10 database through kodekloud_sam user using md5 encrypted password for authentication.

e. At the end its good to test the db connection using these new credentials from root user or server's sudo user.
