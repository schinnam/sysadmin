Problem:
System admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed some issues with DNS resolution in some apps intermittently. 
This time on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues. So we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.


As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS. Please make appropriate changes on this server.

Sol:
Add below to /etc/resolv.conf

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
