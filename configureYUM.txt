Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending item from last month so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.


a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named local_yum and make sure to set Repository ID to local_yum. Configure it to use packages location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package vim-enhanced from this newly created repo.

sol:
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/local_yum.repo

[local_yum]
name=local_yum
baseurl=file:///packages/downloaded_rpms
enabled=1

yum repolist all

yum will look for .repo file in /etc/yum.repo.d/ folder and find required packages.
baseurl = could be local folder, remote website, or artifactory
