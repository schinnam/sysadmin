There are some new tools have been installed on app server in Stratos Datacenter. 
Some of these tools can only be managed from graphical interface. So there are some requirements 
came up for these app servers.


On all App servers in Stratos Datacenter change the default runlevel so that they can boot in GUI (graphical user interface) 
by default.


Sol:
systemctl get-default
systemctl set-default graphical.target
